{% include team_member member_name="Arpad" full_name="Arpad Danos, PhD" bio='Dr. Danos is an Instructor in the Griffith Lab at the McDonnell Genome Institute at Washington University School of Medicine. He received undergraduate degrees in mathematics and physics at the University of Chicago. He performed graduate studies in the fields of Diabetes and Cancer Metabolism and received his PhD from the Committee on Molecular Metabolism and Nutrition and the University of Chicago. He also spent time working in IT as well as teaching science and mathematics, and received the Wayne C. Booth graduate student prize for excellence in teaching while at University of Chicago. His interests include applying and developing mathematical techniques to areas of basic and clinical cancer research, and at the Griffith Lab, his projects include working on the <a href="http://civicdb.org">Clinical Interpretations of Variants in Cancer (CIViC)</a> knowledgebase, as well as characterization of novel mutations important for cancer which exist in non-coding space.' image="/assets/img/team/arpad_danos.jpg" role="Instructor in Medicine" %}

{% include team_member member_name="Kilannin" full_name="Kilannin Krysiak, PhD" bio='Dr. Krysiak is a Fellow of the Laboratory Genetics and Genomics program in the Department of Pathology and Immunology. Her work focuses on the analysis and interpretation of genomic and transcriptomic sequence data produced from a variety of cancer types. Her primary interest is in the use of genomic data to improve the current standards of patient care. Since joining the McDonnell Genome Institute in 2014 she has been involved in comprehensive analysis of cancer patient cohorts as well as small and n-of-1 studies. In collaboration with the Genomics Tumor Board, she has led the analysis of case studies in order to better understand the molecular underpinnings of multiple hematologic cancers. Currently, her primary project is leading the analysis of >400 cases of follicular lymphoma in order to identify genomic events which can predict clinical outcomes for patients with this type of cancer. Applying her experience with these analyses and her predoctoral work on the genetics of myelodysplastic syndromes, she has been part of the team of developers and researchers that created and is actively expanding the open-source, community driven <a href="https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/home">Clinical Interpretations of Variants in Cancer (CIViC) knowledgebase</a>.' image="/assets/img/team/kilannin_krysiak.jpg" role="LGG Fellow" %}

{% include team_member member_name="Jason_S" full_name="Jason Saliba, PhD" bio='Dr. Saliba is an Instructor in the Griffith Lab at the Washington University School of Medicine. He received a BSc in Cell Biology and Molecular Genetics from the University of Maryland in 2006. He completed his PhD in Molecular and Human Genetics in 2015 at Baylor College of Medicine where he studied germline susceptibility genes in pediatric leukemia and pharmacogenetics. His training continued as a postdoctoral fellow studying the pharmacogenetic mechanisms of somatic relapse drivers in pediatric leukemia at NYU Langone Health. Now, he holds the role of Editor for the Clinical Interpretations of Variants in Cancer (CIViC) knowledgebase. His primary responsibilities are the editorial maintenance of CIViC through thorough mining and understanding of peer-reviewed cancer literature, driving the evolution of the knowledgebase, and fostering enhancements through training and collaborations.' image='/assets/img/team/jason_saliba.jpg' role='Instructor of Medicine' %}
